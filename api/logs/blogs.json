If you need a place to start, here’s a great <a href=\"https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/news/introducing-players-to-your-new-fortnite-creative-island-and-map\">onboarding guide</a> that’ll help get you started on your creative journey.</p>\n\n<h2>Welcome Hub Design Guide</h2>\n\n<p>The best Welcome Hubs should empower players to identify content that they want to engage with and provide them with a path to easily navigate the game or island experience. To effectively connect players with content, a successful hub designer will continually iterate on discovery and theme. There are two main types of hub design: the Spoke model and the Cardinal model, you’ll see diagrams for both below and any specific call-outs.</p>\n\n<p>Before getting started with the design guide, let’s review the two hub layout legends to see the major differences and requirements of each.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h4>Spoke</h4>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Hub TopDown Spoke 01\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/hub-topdown-spoke-01-2818x1772-715a652a0aa8.jpg\" style=\"height:auto; width:auto\" /></p>\n\n<h4>Cardinal<img alt=\"Hub TopDown Cardinal 01\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/hub-topdown-cardinal-01-2818x1772-76cd78084ac4.jpg\" style=\"height:auto; width:auto\" /></h4>\n\n<h2>Basic Creative Hub Requirements</h2>\n\n<h3>Load a Featured Hub template to get started and make sure to follow the criteria outlined below...</h3>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">Hub must not exceed 40,000 Memory</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">All social media or creator code callout text must be moved to one specific area outside of the initial spawn point, <strong>not</strong> directly in front of the player when they spawn.</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">Your “Voice Chat” option must be changed from <strong>Team </strong>setting to <strong>All</strong>.</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">Do not include devices which damage or eliminate players.</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">Do not use excessive effects which may result in performance issues for the server.\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li aria-level=\"2\">Moderating the use of particle effects, transparent layers, and physics balls will help limit issues.</li>\n\t\t<li aria-level=\"2\">Avoid using groupings of lights in one spot</li>\n\t\t<li aria-level=\"2\">Do not use excessive amounts of glass\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li aria-level=\"3\"><strong>For example</strong>: Do not have glass overlaying more glass</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</li>\n\t\t<li aria-level=\"2\">Reduce the amount of unique objects as much as possible, especially if only used a few times or within portal area pathways\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li aria-level=\"3\"><strong>For example</strong>: Using 100 unique objects is worse than using 100 of the same objects (regarding memory usage and performance)</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">Do not include game mechanics which obstruct or distract players from the portal area pathways.</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">The center spawn arena must be flat, <strong>obstruction-free</strong>, and be a maximum of one tile high.</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">Make sure you have included 4 player spawn points for the Epic Games Creative team to review the quality level of the hub. Note: We may request changes based on our review process.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">If you choose to include hidden easter eggs or interactions within your Hub, you <strong>must </strong>submit an additional video showing all hidden content</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">You must have player flight turned on for QA testing. It will be removed by us if necessary.\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li aria-level=\"2\">Do not place blocking volumes in the sky until <strong>after </strong>you’ve placed the above required 2-4 player spawns for reviews.</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">Matchmaking portals must stay in designated areas and be placed by the creator.</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">Do not alter default player movement speed.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>If your Creative Island has met these requirements, let’s move to to how you can iterate on your hub’s discovery and theme!&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2>New Creative Hub Layout Philosophy</h2>\n\n<p>Now that we’ve covered the specific required things you need for your hub to be considered for Epic featuring, let’s dig into how you can really make it pop and easy to navigate!</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Portal areas should be treated as the primary destination and not a secondary location.</li>\n\t<li>Hub layout should clearly convey how you want the player to interact and navigate.&nbsp;</li>\n\t<li>Utilize the 4 Portal area pathways.</li>\n\t<li>You can freely customize the areas located at the rear of the Hub.</li>\n\t<li>Signs/Iconography above the pathways should have no competing elements.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Design Guidelines</h2>\n\n<p>Moving on to aesthetics guidelines! all areas within the Hub should be cohesive with the theme of the world and contain a purposeful interaction with the player.</p>\n\n<h3>Choosing a Theme</h3>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">Pick a strong singular theme</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><img alt=\"SummerHub 05\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/summerhub-05-2550x1231-92186b0565e0.jpg\" style=\"height:auto; width:auto\" /></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Create visually interesting areas in the map with purpose for the player\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li><strong>For Example</strong>: The best hubs have visually interesting areas that are laid out with the purpose of directing players to feature content.</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>Ensure you properly research the theme you are attempting to replicate within your hub when executing on the overall visuals within the map</li>\n\t<li>Play around with&nbsp; adjusting settings, including:\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>Time of Day</li>\n\t\t<li>Camera Filter</li>\n\t\t<li>Light Brightness</li>\n\t\t<li>Light Color</li>\n\t\t<li>Fog Thickness</li>\n\t\t<li>Fog Color</li>\n\t\t<li>Gravity</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Navigation Tips</h3>\n\n<p>Your players should know where to go.</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">Beginning at the player spawn, include straight and clearly defined pathways that allow players to easily navigate to portal areas.\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li aria-level=\"2\">Portals must remain in the designated areas.</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">Do not create distractions which direct players away from the main portal areas.</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">Utilize design around the portal areas.</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">The spawn area must be clear so players don’t spawn into objects.</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">Paths to each portal area should be clear, unobstructed, and not include any distractions.&nbsp;</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">Clear separation of navigation signage within the Hub</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><img alt=\"PortalPathGatewayObscured Bad\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/portalpathgatewayobscured-bad-2560x1440-a2807a9e819c.jpg\" style=\"height:auto;

width:auto\" /></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">Sign and icons within the portal areas should match the environment.&nbsp;</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">Remove any line of sight (LOS) blockers to each area.</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">Do not create pathways that players are unable to tell apart from the surrounding environment\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li aria-level=\"2\"><strong>For Example</strong>: Grass pathways in a lush green environment&nbsp;</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">Adjust your matchmaking portals to fit the design needs of that area, but they must remain the designated location.\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li aria-level=\"2\"><strong>For Example</strong>: If you make a circular room for your portal area, you can adjust the portals to fit the curvature of the space you have chosen.</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><img alt=\"MatchmakingPortals Bad 02\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/matchmakingportals-bad-02-2560x1360-fad7d13838d6.jpg\" style=\"height:auto;

First the Mothership, then the Saucers, and now… Abductors? We think that might be what the Aliens call them, as the IO seems to use this term regularly.<br />\n<br />\nWe’ve put together some more files for all you to look at. (See attached.)<br />\n<br />\n-Mari<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<hr />\n<h2><br />\nFile on Abductors</h2>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Fortnite Abductor\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/fortnite-abductor-1920x1080-f0970c067145.jpg\" style=\"height:auto; width:auto\" /><br />\n<br />\nAbductors hover over certain places and... kind of just stay put. But only for a little while. After some time, it’ll send beams at the ground, taking away those who decide to walk in them. Some who claim to have been abducted say they were taken to the Mothership, but we don’t know what the Aliens would have to gain. Why let people see the Mothership then bring them back home?<br />\n<br />\nIn any case, there seems to be more in it for the abductees than the Aliens. After returning, abductees tend to come back with powerful weapons. “The more orange-looking orbs we were able to collect in the Mothership, the better stuff we were allowed to leave with,” one abductee says. “We could even extend the time limit if we found orbs with the little clocks on them.”<br />\n<br />\nYou can see the&nbsp;locations of Abductors on your map. They visit in cycles, so we recommend investigating them thoroughly each time they’re here. Because Abductors only have so much space,&nbsp;there’s a capacity as to how many one can abduct at once.<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<hr />\n<h2><br />\nFile on Alien Parasites</h2>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Fortnite Alien Parasite\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/fortnite-alien-parasite-1920x1080-826133a1b07a.jpg\" style=\"height:auto; width:auto\" /><br />\n<br />\nIt makes sense that Aliens would have their own version of wildlife. And it looks like their wildlife is very keen on ours. The Aliens have unleashed a parasitic species on the Island, introducing a new danger to the ecosystem. However, they’re actually more helpful than the Aliens probably intended.<br />\n<br />\nKnown simply as Parasites, if one of these mini-Aliens attach to your head, they’ll drain your Health down to 60. (Shield remains unaffected.) But this relationship is more give-and-take than it seems. Not only do they protect you from headshot damage, but they also make you run faster and jump higher. Parasites have an aversion to water, fire, and, unsurprisingly, attacks.<br />\n<br />\nThese creatures can often be seen parasitizing chickens, boars, and wolves. If you take damage from parasitized wildlife, their slime will gradually deplete some of your Health. Defeating an animal with a Parasite on it will make that Parasite jump on you, which could very well be a sound strategy. We expect their population to grow as they adapt to the Island.<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p><br />\n<em>What else is new in Fortnite Battle Royale in v17.10:</em></p>\n\n<h2><br />\nSaucers Hacked by IO Operatives</h2>\n\n<p>In a decisive blow against the Alien invaders, the Imagined Order has hacked their flying Saucers.
